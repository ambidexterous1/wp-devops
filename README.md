# WP DevOps

WP DevOps is a general purpose DevOps solutions for WordPress.  

It allows for building, testing and deploying WordPress using [CircleCI 2.0](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/) for continuous integration from a Git provider like [GitHub](https://github.com/) to [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) _(and soon [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/))_ as web host(s).  

Of course WP DevOps supports [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and most any other Git provider.

## Our Vision
Our vision is to make the best practices of setting up and running continuous integration, testing and deployment _**brain-dead easy**_. More to come on how we will make this happen in the near future...

## Our Plans
We plan to expand WP DevOps to support as many Continuous Integration Providers as possible and to support as many Web Hosts as possible. Along those lines we'll be adding documentation as we evolve this solution. 
If you have an interest in helping us or contributing financially to have us add specific support sooner, please contact us [**via our Slack**](https://launchpass.com/wplib).
