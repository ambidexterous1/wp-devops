# WP DevOps

WP DevOps is a general purpose DevOps solutions for WordPress.  It allows for building, testing and deploying WordPress using [CircleCI v1.0](https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/) for continuous integration and either [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) or [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/) as web hosts.  Of course we also support [GitHub](https://github.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and most any other Git provider.

## Our Vision
Our vision is to make the best practices of setting up and running continuous integration, testing and deployment _**brain-dead easy**_. More to come on how we will make this happen in the near future...

## Our Plans
We plan to expand WP DevOps to support as many Continuous Integration Providers as possible and to support as many Web Hosts as possible. Along those lines we'll be adding documentation as we evolve this solution.
