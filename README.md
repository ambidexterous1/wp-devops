# wp-devops

WP DevOps is a general purpose DevOps solutions for WordPress.  It allows for building, testing and deploying WordPress using CirleCI v1.0 and either WPEngine or Pantheon.

However, our goal is to expand WP DevOps to support as many Continuous Integration Providers as possible and to support as many Web Hosts as possible. Along those lines we'll be adding documentation as we evolve this solution.
